# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
